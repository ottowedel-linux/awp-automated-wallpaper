# Example AWP ini Configuration
# Copy this file together with awp_setup.py, awp_daemon.py, awp_nav.py
# to ~/awp/ as awp_config.ini and edit with your wallpaper folder and
# desired icon paths for each worspace like the example below. The example
# is for 3 workspaces, but using awp_setup you could setup with less or more
# workspaces. And make sure to select the appropriate os_detected and session_type.
#
# NOTE: If conky is enabled, AWP will write wallpaper information to:
#       ~/awp/conky/.awp_conky_state.txt
#       Make sure this directory exists if you plan to use Conky integration.
